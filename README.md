# GDPR-Extensions-com - Matomo 2xClick Solution

GDPR-Extensions-com - Matomo 2xClick Solution allows you to add your tracking script to one or multiple pages on your website without being flagged on Cookie scanners!

This extension works in parallel with our [GDPR-extensions.com](https://gdpr-extensions.com) Consent Manager, where your website viewers can update their cookie preferences at any time!

## Features

### Without GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager:
- The Matomo cookie will not be created, and user analytics will not be sent to your Matomo dashboard until they consent.
- Once the user has consented, you will start getting analytic events on your Matomo dashboard as the cookie is created. The default session duration is 30 days.
- Users will not be able to update their cookie preferences, and their data will be saved until the session has expired.

### With GDPR-extensions.com Consent Manager:
- The GDPR-Extensions-com Consent Manager TYPO3 extension is powered by the gdpr-extensions.com dashboard.
- This scans your website and auto-detects cookies and external sources.
- Provides a content element “Consent Manager” that lists all cookies and allows users to manage the Matomo 2 Click cookie at any time.
- Website viewers can view the Consent Manager anytime by clicking on the cookie widget, which you can customize in styling, language, content, and position.
